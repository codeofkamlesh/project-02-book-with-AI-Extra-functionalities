# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to humanoid robotics using modern tools and frameworks. This book covers the complete pipeline from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for humanoid robot control.

## Book Structure

This book follows a 4-model architecture:

1. **ROS2 Foundations** - Core concepts of Robot Operating System 2
2. **Simulation** - Gazebo and Unity environments for robot simulation
3. **NVIDIA Isaac** - Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS for perception and control
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Multimodal AI for humanoid control

Each section builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive learning path from basic concepts to advanced applications.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Developers exploring robotics and AI integration
- Students learning humanoid robot control
- Engineers implementing multimodal AI systems
- Researchers working on robotic perception and action

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended)
- Understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Access to appropriate hardware for simulation (see system requirements)

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter includes:
- Theoretical concepts with practical examples
- Code snippets with explanations
- Simulation examples you can run
- Exercises to reinforce learning
- References to official documentation

Let's begin our journey into the world of AI-driven humanoid robotics!
